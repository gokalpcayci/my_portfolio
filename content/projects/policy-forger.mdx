policy forger is a platform where you can generate privacy policy and terms of service pages for your website. These pages are generated based on the information you provide, and you can customize them to fit your needs.

The generated content for visual aestehtics streamed while it is being generated. The generated content is also editable and you can make changes to it before copying it.
