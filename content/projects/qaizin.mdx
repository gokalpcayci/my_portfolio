In this project, I collaborated with a designer to meet my client's needs and create a visually appealing platform. The website features a sleek, modern design with a dark theme that aligns with the cryptocurrency industry's aesthetic. The site also contains contact and blog pages. I gave the project with dummy links, as the client will later add the necessary content because of that the links are not working.

##Challenges Faced

During development, we encountered several challenges. Some dependencies did not align well with others. For instance, I initially used Contentlayer for blog creation, but as it became unmaintained and failed to meet my needs, I had to switch to Velite, which was a better fit.

Another major issue was image quality. When exporting images from Figma, they often appeared blurry even though i exported with the max quality settings. To counter this, I used optimized SVGs for certain images. However, this introduced a new problem: some SVG filters caused blurriness in Safari but not in Chrome. After extensive research and trial-and-error, I identified specific filters and opacity values that led to this issue and adjusted them accordingly.

Additionally, implementing the background spotlight and starry background animation took considerable effort. Despite the time investment, I am highly satisfied with the final result, as it adds a unique aesthetic to the platform.
