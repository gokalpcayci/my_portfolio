DEU Web Registration Notifier is a Python bot developed for students at Dokuz Eylül University. This bot continuously monitors the course registration page, detects available course slots, and instantly notifies students via WhatsApp.

I developed this project to simplify the course registration process for university students. By automating a process that previously required constant manual checking, we created a system that saves students time. With WhatsApp integration, users receive instant notifications and can take quick action.
