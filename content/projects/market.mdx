EnvShare is a simple tool to share environment variables securely. It uses
**AES-GCM** to encrypt your data before sending it to the server. The encryption
key never leaves your browser.

## Features

- **Shareable Links:** Share your environment variables securely by sending a
  link
- **End-to-End Encryption:** AES-GCM encryption is used to encrypt your data
  before sending it to the server
- **Limit number of reads:** Limit the number of times a link can be read
- **Auto Expire:** Automatically expire links and delete data after a certain
  time
