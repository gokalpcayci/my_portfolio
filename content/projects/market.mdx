Market is a simplified version of an e-commerce. This was assigned to me for a job application. This is the only project i used Vite over Next.js because this was intended to evaluate my react knowledge. I took this technical case and put lots of effort because at the time i was thinking why not put this in a portfolio if i ever create one, and here we are :)

## Features

products come from a json file and the images comes from the unsplash api. You can filter through the products and paginate through them. Although the products are not real, you can add them to your cart and remove them from your cart. The cart is stored in the local storage so you can refresh the page and still see the products in your cart.
